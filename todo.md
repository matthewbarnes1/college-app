## TODO

## User Authentication
- User Clerk or similar service for google auth 
- Provide specific auth server so that (.edu emails --> verification): This will ensure that the user is from a college
- For specific colleges, we can use regex ex: (name@school.edu): School.edu can be verification for specific school name

## Database 
- What do I want in the DB? 

**Some ideas**
- User: Profile, connections
- Clubs: Club name, club details, etc
- Events: Current events around campus (sports games, partys, out goings, etc)

## Client
- Clean UI using react and other libraries (some animation libraries for smooth transitions etc)

## Profile Details
- Name, age, major, interests (from list)
- Description and profile photo image

## Account settings
- Current email linked 
- Password and name associated with account

## Chat
- THis would be cool - have live chatstreams for each club/event
- Ability to create DM to other students

## Club Corner
- Upon login/signup (or in profile), have the option to add/create a club on the site
- This step needs human verification to ensure that the clubs being posted are legit
- Club Corner is a place to explore clubs and any related club events
